# School-Machine_Learning_Introduction
 
Hello,

I took a machine learning course as part of my second year. During this course, we had to do a practical work in groups of two. The goal of this lab was to make us practice two aspects of machine learning: Supervised Machine Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning. We implemented with Python the KMeans method, the EM-clustering, a SVM and PCA. We also created neural networks with a MultiLayer Perceptron and a Convolutional Neural Network.

You can't compile this script because the database was too heavy to be transferred. 
However, you can still look at the output of each script.
